<h1>Logging in and out</h1></a>
<h2>Log in</h2>
Logging in to your Bioclipse account (and then also your different third-parts account) is simple; just choose <b>File > log in</b> or click on the orange padlock in the status line at 
the bottom of the bioclipse window. Then fill in your username and password in the dialog that appears. When you have logged in the padlock will become green.<br>
If you can't find any log-in, it's probably because you don't have any feature that supports this installed, or that you don't have created any Bioclipse account yet. You can read about how to creat one in <a 
href="accountWizardHelp.html">Creating a new user account</a>.<br>
If, for some reason, Bioclipse failed to log-in to any of your third-part accounts, you will get a dialog telling you for which of them that the log in failed. Then check your internet connection and/or your 
user settings for the third-part account(s) that failed. This is done in <b>Window > Preferences... > Users</b>, see <a href="usingPrefs.html">Using Preferences</a> for more information. 
However, you will still be logged in to your Bioclipse account and third that didn't failed to log in.<br><br>
<h2>Log out</h2>
Logging out is done by either choosing <b> log out</b> from the <b>File</b>-menu (this option is only visibly when you are logged in) or by click on the green padlock at the bottom of the Bioclipse
window. You will then get a question if you are sure that you want to log out. If you don't want to be asked this any more, just mark the checkbox in the dialog before clicking on OK. 
This can also be set in <b>Window > Preferences... > Users</b> with help of the checkbox &quot;Always logout without prompt&quot;, see also <a href="usingPrefs.html">Using Preferences</a>.
