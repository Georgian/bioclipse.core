<h1>Using Preferences</h1>
<img src="../images/userPrefs.png" width="300" align="right">
You administrate your account(s) in the user view of Bioclipse preferences. Choose <b>Window > Preferences </b> and then <b>Users</b> in the list to the left of the preferences dialog to open it.<br>
The user view has a list of all your accounts and beneath it there is some buttons:<br>
<table>
<tr><td><a href="#create">Create...</a></td><td>Create a new user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#edit">Edit...</a></td><td>Edit the user account selected in the list above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Delete</td><td>Delete the selected user account in the list above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Always logout without prompt</td><td>If this is checked in then you don't get any warning when logging out. See also <a href="loginoutHelp.html">Logging in and out</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Restore Defaults</td><td>Restore the settings to default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apply</td><td>Apply the settings. I.e. it does the same as the OK-button but with out closing the preferences window.</td></tr>
</table> 
<br>
<a name="create"><h2>Create a new user account</h2></a>
To create a new Bioclipse user-account click on the button labeled <b>Create...</b> and a dialog looking almost as the one in the section <a href="accountWizardHelp.html#fig1">Creating a new user account</a> appears.
In the top field you fill in your (Bioclipse) username, in the middle your password and then repeat it in the filed at the bottom. Then click the OK-button.
<br>
<a name="edit"><h2>Edit the user account</h2></a>
<img src="../images/editAccount.png" width="400"><br>
Before the edit dialog appears you will be prompt for the chosen user accounts password. Fill it in and click ok. Now the Edit-dialog (see above) will appear. To the left is a list with 
the different third-part accounts associated with this user account. To the right is a <a href="#propView">view with the properties</a> of the account selected in the account list. The 
four buttons above and below the account list are:
<table>
<tr><td>Change Bioclipse Account Password</a></td><td>Opens a dialog where you can change the password to this user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#Pref3part">Add account...</a></td><td>Create a new third-part account.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#edit3part">Edit account...</a></td><td>Edit the properties of the selected third-part account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Delete account</td><td>Delete the selected third-patrt account.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<a name="propView"><h3>The account properties view</h3></a>
This view contain all information about the third-part account. The uppermost is what type of account it is, e.g. OpenTox. Beneath is a spread sheet with the different properties, their 
value and whether it's required or not. You may change the value of the different properties by changing it in the spread sheet or by using the <a href="edit3part">Edit...-button</a>
to the left. One more thing worth to notice is the checkbox called "Show password" to the right and beneath the spread sheet. Selecting it and all the hidden values will be in plain language.
<a name="Pref3part"><h3>Add a third-part account</h3></a>
When clicking on the Add account-button a new window that look a lot like and with the same function as the one described in <a href="accountWizardHelp.html#Wizard3part">Add a third-part 
account</a> appears. If the button is not enable, it's probably because you do not have any feature that need a web-service installed.<br>
The first thing to do is to choose the account type, i.e. which feature you want to create a third-part account to, this is done in the dropdown-menu at the top. Then 
fill in the information that Bioclipse need to be able to log in to the third-part account. You may also change the name of the third-part account. Now click the <b>Finich</b>-button, then 
the new third-part account is added to your Bioclipse user-account and you return to the edit-dialog.<br>
If you are logged in to a user account you may have to log out and then log in again to let Bioclipse log in to the new third-part account, see <a href="loginoutHelp.html">Logging in and
 out</a>. 
<a name="edit3part"><h3>Edit a third part account</h3></a>
Clicking on this button and a simple dialog where the value of the properties of the third-part account can be edit appears. Just change the value of the property or properties, e.g. 
the password, and then click ok. If you are logged in to the account when changing the properties, you may also have to log out and then log in again to the user account for the changes 
to take effect, see <a href="loginoutHelp.html">Logging in and out</a>.
