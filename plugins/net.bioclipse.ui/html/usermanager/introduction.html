<h1>Introduction</h1>
To be able to use all the capabilities that some of the features in Bioclipse (e.g. OpenTox) offers to you, you need to log on to 
their web-service. In Bioclipse this is done via an Bioclipse account where the 
the required information, normally your log-in name and password for the web-service, are stored.
Then when you log-in to your Bioclipse account you will be automatically logged in to the installed 
features web-services.<br>
You can easy see if you are logged in, then a green padlock will be visibly in the bottom of the Bioclipse window. See more of how to
log in to your Bicoclipse account in the section <a href="loginoutHelp.html">Logging in to a Bioclipse User account</a>, and how to create 
a Bioclipse account and add the information needed to log in to a third-part account in the section <a href="accountWizardHelp.html">
