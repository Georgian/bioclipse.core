This will describe the new account wizard...
To be able to use some features (e.g. OpenTox) you need to log on to 
there web-service. In Bioclipse this is done via an Bioclipse account where the 
the required information, normally your log-in name and password for the web-service, are stored.
 Then when you log-in to your Bioclipse account you will be automatically logged in to the installed 
 features web-services.
